# Purpose: requirements file to create a conda environment suitable for TensorFlow with GPU support
# for CARB RSDAS development.  TensorFlow is very picky about packaging versions, don't change the core
# library versions unless you are very confident about their compatability.

# Key package versions:
# Python version: 3.10.13
# GPU packages: cudatoolkit=11.2, cudnn=8.1.0
# TensorFlow Version: 2.10.1

# Created by: Tony Held
# Last updated: 2024-03-18

# Notes:
# 1) Make sure you are at a mini-conda shell prompt (not cmd or full anaconda prompt) for all
#    command line interaction
# 2) If you are having compatibility problems, try to create a new environment from scratch rather than
#    trying to update an environment that is giving you trouble.
# 3) Initial creation of environment
#    a) Copy this file to a local directory.  On tony's machine it is at "C:\one_drive\code\requirements\mini_conda_02.yml"
#    b) Search/replace text below to match your requirement's file path
#    c) change the line starting with "name:" to the desired name of your environment
#    d) search and replace the previous environment name to your new preferred name
#    e) run the codeblock below at your mini-conda shell prompt:
        # conda update conda
        # conda env list
        # conda remove --name mini_conda_02 --all
        # conda deactivate
        # conda env create -f "C:\one_drive\code\requirements\mini_conda_02.yml"
# 4) Updating your environment
#    a) Do not run conda or pip from the command line to update/install individual packages.
#    b) Make sure you only update your environment by modifying this resource file and then
#       running the update command below
#    c) Try to install packages via conda and only use pip if there is a not a conda version available
#    d) conda installs should always be prior to pip installs, using this file enforces this requirement
#    e) do not change the 'name:' line for your update (if you want a new name, create a new requirements file)
#    f) run the codeblock below
        # conda activate mini_conda_02
        # conda env update --file "C:\one_drive\code\requirements\mini_conda_02.yml" --prune
# 5) Google instructions on windows and linux tensorflow installation:
#    https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native
# 6) Place your custom channels in order of preference (likely before defaults)
# 7) You can specify the channel with the notation: - chanelname::modulename=X.Y.Z
# 8) specify version with one equals sign for conda and two equals sign for pip
# 9) if you are getting dependency errors consider conda clean (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/clean.html)
#      conda clean --all

# change the name of your environment with the variable below when you first create the environment
# do not change the name during environment updates
name: mini_conda_02
channels:
  # Include any other channels here if your package is not in defaults
